## Part I: Twitter-to-Kafka

The **Twitter-to-Kafka Service** is the first microservice developed in this project. It is responsible for ingesting real-time data from Twitter (or mock implementations) and publishing it to Apache Kafka for downstream processing. Below is an outline of its development and key functionalities:

### 1. Spring Boot
The service was built using the **spring-boot-maven-plugin**, which streamlined the configuration of dependencies, build processes, and application packaging. This setup laid the foundation for the development of the microservice.

### 2. Twitter4J
The service uses **Twitter4J**, a Java library for accessing Twitter APIs, to stream real-time tweets. The streamed data is processed as events, which form the core of the event-driven architecture. For environments where accessing Twitter API is infeasible, a **mock Twitter stream** was implemented as an alternative, ensuring smooth development and testing.

### 3. Apache Kafka
The integration with **Apache Kafka** is a cornerstone of the service, enabling event sourcing and asynchronous communication. Key components include:
- **Kafka Producers**: Events are produced and published to Kafka topics.
- **Event Storage**: Kafka acts as the event store, managing topics and partitions for scalability and fault tolerance.

To streamline Kafka interactions, modular components were introduced:
- **Kafka Model Module**: Defines the data structure of events.
- **Kafka Admin Module**: Manages Kafka topics programmatically, ensuring proper configuration and setup.
- **Kafka Producer Module**: Handles producer configurations and implements the logic for publishing events.

### 4. Docker Containerization
The service was containerized using **Docker**, creating a lightweight and portable image. This enabled seamless deployment and integration with other services via **Docker Compose**. Services mentioned later are also containerized with Docker.

### Workflow Overview
1. Tweets are fetched in real time using **Twitter4J** or mock streams.
2. Data is transformed into event objects and validated.
3. Events are published to Kafka topics using **Kafka Producers**.
4. The Kafka cluster, managed via Docker, handles event storage and distribution.



## Part II: Kafka-to-Elastic

The **Kafka-to-Elastic-Service** serves as a critical intermediary microservice in the system, responsible for consuming events from Kafka and indexing the data into Elasticsearch. This service bridges the event-streaming capabilities of Kafka with the powerful search and analytics capabilities of Elasticsearch.

### 1. **Kafka Consumer Integration**

- A **Kafka Consumer** was implemented to subscribe to Kafka topics and read data events in real time.
- The **kafka-consumer module** was added to manage consumer configurations and ensure reliable message consumption.

### 2. Elasticsearch

- **Elasticsearch** was introduced as the data store for indexing and searching the event data.
- The service uses **Elasticsearch repositories**, providing a seamless way to index and retrieve data through Spring Data Elasticsearch.

​	**Modular Design for Elasticsearch**

- The service incorporates several modules for Elasticsearch integration:
    - **Elastic-Model Module**: Defines the data structure for indexing in Elasticsearch.
    - **Elastic-Config Module**: Centralizes configuration for connecting to the Elasticsearch cluster.
    - **Elastic-Index-Client Module**: Handles indexing operations and encapsulates the Elasticsearch client functionality.

### 3. Docker Containerization

- Like other services, the **Kafka-to-Elastic-Service** was containerized using **Docker**.

### Workflow Overview

1. The service consumes events from Kafka topics using the Kafka Consumer.

2. Consumed events are validated and transformed into Elasticsearch-compatible documents.

3. These documents are then indexed into Elasticsearch, enabling efficient querying and analytics.



## Part III: Spring Cloud Config

The configuration of microservices in this project is centralized and streamlined using **Spring Cloud Config**. This approach simplifies managing application settings across multiple environments, enabling consistency and scalability while also addressing security concerns. The **Twitter-to-Kafka Service**, **Kafka-to-Elastic Service** and other services were adapted to retrieve their configurations from the Spring Cloud Config Server.

### **1. Spring Cloud Config Server**

A **Spring Cloud Config Server** was created as a standalone microservice to centralize all configuration files. This server allows all microservices to retrieve their configurations dynamically at runtime.

### 2. **Common Logging Configuration**

A shared **logback** configuration file was introduced to unify logging settings across all microservices. This ensures consistent log levels and formats, improving debugging and monitoring.

### 3. Security

To safeguard sensitive information, such as API keys and database credentials. The encryption ensures that sensitive data remains secure, even if the configuration repository is exposed:
- **Jasypt** was used to encrypt configuration data directly within the files.
- **Java Cryptography Extension (JCE)** was also employed as an alternative encryption mechanism, providing robust security for critical information.

The use of **Spring Cloud Config** provides several advantages for the microservices architecture. It enables centralized management of configuration files, reducing redundancy and improving maintainability. The approach also ensures scalability, as new services can seamlessly integrate with the Config Server to maintain consistent configurations. Furthermore, by encrypting sensitive data, the system enhances security, ensuring confidentiality and compliance with best practices.



## Part IV: Elastic Query Service

The **Elastic Query Service** is designed to provide an interface for querying the data stored in Elasticsearch. As the query component of the **CQRS** pattern, this microservice allows clients to perform advanced searches and retrieve data efficiently, with added support for API versioning, validation, and HATEOAS.

### 1. Elastic Query API and Module

- The service utilizes the **Spring Data Elasticsearch Repository** to query indexed data in Elasticsearch. This simplifies the querying process while leveraging Elasticsearch’s powerful search capabilities.

- The **elastic-query-client module** encapsulates the logic for interacting with Elasticsearch, ensuring modularity and separation of concerns.

- A REST API was created to expose Elasticsearch query capabilities. It includes a **web controller** to handle incoming requests and a business layer to process queries and return results to clients.

### 2. Validation

- Validation mechanisms ensure incoming queries are well-formed and adhere to predefined criteria.
- A **Controller Advice** layer handles exceptions gracefully, providing meaningful error messages to clients.

### 3. **HATEOAS Integration**

- The service integrates **HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State)**, enriching API responses with links to related resources. This supports a more dynamic and discoverable API design.

### 4. API

- API versioning was implemented to ensure backward compatibility as the service evolves. Clients can access different versions of the API without disruption.

- The service uses **Open API v3** and **Swagger** to document the REST API. This provides a user-friendly interface for exploring endpoints and their capabilities.

### 5. Docker Containerization

- Like other microservices, the **Elastic Query Service** was containerized using **Docker**.

### Workflow
- Clients send query requests to the **REST API**.
- The request is validated and processed by the business layer.
- The **elastic-query-client module** interacts with Elasticsearch to fetch relevant data.
- The response is enriched with **HATEOAS** links and returned to the client.
